# Moment code

This is a repository, which contains all my code typed in moments, so I called it `moment-code`.

The contents in repo is originally stored in GitHub, and I get a webhook to push to [Gitee](https://gitee.com/Promesis/moment-code) on every push.

All codes are **freely distributable and released in MIT License**.

I used PowerShell to build everything. The scripts are all available on any platforms, just install `pwsh` on any OS including Linux and macOS, run the `build-all.ps1`, and it will build everything automatically.

I used GitHub Actions to make CI possible. 

**Enjoy.**
