# Moment code

This is a repository, which contains all my code typed in moments, so I called it `moment-code`.

The contents in repo is originally stored in GitHub, and I get a webhook to push to [Gitee](https://gitee.com/Promesis/moment-code) on every push.

All codes are **freely distributable and released in MIT License**.

**Enjoy.**
